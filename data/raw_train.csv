If we can't do water right, how can we do anything else right? It's a freaking joke. Our whole governmental system is a mess. And yet, no one does anything.",anger
342,"It doesn't matter what country you live in. The powerful will always stomp on the weak. Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.",anger
247,"This is a terrible story, but we can't go so far as to blame an entire religion for the actions of some. We hope what happened to Paris never happens again, but we simply need a bit more security and people with their eyes open - not attitudes against an entire religion or people. Consider these unfortunate ways of rallying countries behind one cause of peace.",sadness

They tried so hard to save this rhino, and unfortunately the baby rhino named Thula is the area that this happened in. It never gets easier. The other rhinos here are being taken care of, but it was a great loss, and we all feel so bad about it. The name of the baby rhino was Isibindi, and she will be missed.",sadness
119,This was a somewhat interesting article about the frequency of eye injuries in sports for children.  They really could have used more data in the article but interesting all the same.  The only real gripe I had was somehow playing with airsoft guns around the house are counted as sports related injuries so the data doesn't seem that reliable.,surprise
215,"So, I just read an article that I have absolutely no interest in. It was a bunch of gossip about Val Kilmer's health, as if that is newsworthy. I'm not even sure why I read the whole thing. I gained nothing in the way of knowledge by reading this article. What a waste of time! People really should learn how to mind their own business.",anger
387,These type of events of bomb explosions and terrorist threats are extremely dangerous and should be taken very seriously. People are just going around for their day and they don't really know what could happen to them and these type of incidents are very tragic and hurtful. The security measures in the United States should be more careful and should check anyone that is suspicious and make the country a safer place than how it already is.,fear
300,"That's interesting about the buzzing possibly being created by the brain. I always thought it was created by the auditory nerve. Someone very close to me deals with tinnitus every day, and I always thought it was odd because I'm the one who has worked in high noise environments, but she's the one who suffers with it. It's interesting because it says psychotherapy is a possible solution which would make us very happy if it's real.",surprise
180,"We live in a world someone can not only be arrested for their thoughts, but can be seen as a target for violence from monsters. From the shooter, to the local government, these actions should be condemned on all fronts. The government was wrong to arrest the deceased, and the murderer was of course wrong for shooting him to death . I am saddened that someone lost his life because of his charge of a charged message. While I do feel glad that apparent justice will be served in this case, this just goes to show you how violent some people can become when you toss religious ideals into the mix.",sadness

Children passing out in the streets simply because they have no food to eat is heartbreaking. No one should have to suffer simply because they can't afford food. There needs to be another option.",sadness

I would never want to this to happen to me or my daughter. I will have to really take care of my our lenses from now and on to prevent any damage.,fear
157,"This sort of story is showing up far too much in the news anymore.  It shows a deepening divide of racial tensions in America, which is something I thought we had finally put behind us.  That being said, I mean that the racial tension is coming from BOTH sides, not just one side or the other.  BOTH sides need to be held accountable for their actions and the divide they are creating in this country.",fear

126,I honestly can't believe I just read that whole article about a frog. I absolutely despise them. They are some of the most vile creatures on this earth. Ew. But.... there was something pretty interesting at the end of the article. One of the researchers claim that over half of all species will be extinct by the end of the century. That is insane!!!! Pretty sure most of that is due to climate change but we have Donald Asshat and Company who refuse to acknowledge it or its repercussions.,disgust
280,I can't even imagine what it would be like to be minding our own business in a club and then having someone come in and shoot you. This must have been terrifying for this person. I certainly hope they did not lose their life and I also hope this is not an incident that leads to further problems in the future.,fear
121,"This article greatly disturbs me. The fact that we treat Muslims and people of their culture like dogs and terrorist is disgusting and wrong both morally and ethically. The way they are being shown on tv and media is wrong and horrible. Our president thinks that if we ban muslims from the country, all of a sudden our nation is safe. When the fact of the matter is, most shootings that happen in this country, are from Caucasians. Muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment.",disgust

The footage, shot and posted to Facebook on Wednesday, shows a woman struggling with two officers who apparently believe there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest.

105,"Hey,  Measles is still killing kids around the world basically in the countries that don't take care of their people. The governments and terrorist organizations like Boko Haram don't care about kids. I gotta think this is just another example of pure evil, killing kids all the while the government takes aid, money, food, or whatever and keeps it for themselves or sells it to the people and puts them in servitude. God bless the USA!",disgust
249,"Hey, remember that eighties song ""You Spin me Right Round"" that people like to laugh about? The guy responsible for that just dies recently, he seemed like he was pretty interesting. I heard that he was on the UK version of Celebrity Big Brother, but I bet that show is just as boring as the American version. It's so interesting how the celebrity culture over there compares to over here.",neutral
296,"Positions of power will ALWAYS, inevitably be taken over by a corrupt and greedy type of individual or group of people.  Any time you have a person who has authority over another person, eventually things will go bad.  Whether it's kings demanding that they get to deflower any bride before her wedding day (as a law) or our own United States government attempting to strip more and more freedoms from us when we're already slaves... These are the acts of corruption.  These are the acts of cowardice, scum-bag gangsters that wear suits.",disgust

Remember when that factory burned down in Bangladesh? And we can't pretend this isn't our problem too, when we support them economically. If we buy products created in unsafe working conditions, we have a hand in those deaths too.",sadness
335,A man has took it on himself to kill evasive mice that have doubled in size on an island. The mice feed on birds and when the birds have babies its like a buffet for them to thrive on. I imagine it must be disgusting to have so many mice doing what they please and destroying other animals. It gives me the creeps thinking about it.,disgust

25,"If you are using trumps name to make him look bad is not the answer here. I know that trump is not being a good president right now but lets not discredit his success. Somebody burned a church that is not related to Donald Trump at all, lots of Families go to that church. I think someone used this attack as an attack to Donald Trump because he is not affiliated with this and makes people look like he caused this",disgust
406,"It would appear to me, in my opinion, the liberal, nonsensical, mainstream media is at it again. Let's use fear-mongering and misinformation to stir up a demographic in our all out effort against Donald Trump. I feel for those who don't read the actual proposals and/or legislation but instead decide to believe every word uttered by the talking head on TV.",anger

The article says that the business will remain open, but I think it would be best to close up shop.

225,Its crazy that really intense and sad situations are happening around the world but here in USA were worried more about who made it passed the first round of the Voice or whats the latest viral videos. The fact the extremists are using innocent civilians as human shields is so cowardly and shows they have no honor what so ever.,disgust
100,"It is extremely upsetting that there is a cultural war going on and no one seems to care. The values of muslims in general are not compatible with western culture. Further more, it is an ideology that promotes violence and terrorism. Until people become less tolerant of this disgusting dogma, things like this will continue to happen. If muslims want to be viewed in a better light in the west, they need to work on reforming their religion from within.",sadness
284,This is so disturbing. It says that they are killing chickens that are still awake during it. It's like they like torturing them. Why can't we be like Europe? In Europe they have rules on how this is supposed to be done. No we just let companies do whatever they like. How hard it is to kill something and make sure it's not awake while doing so?,disgust
387,These home grown terrorists are becoming more and more of a problem. How do we monitor better people who are already in this country? Stopping immigration is not going to solve this problem. It is the people right here in our own country who are killing each other. That problem has to be solved!!! How do we keep tabs on people and catch them before they kill their fellow citizens?,anger

This is a sick regime and I am glad that America and its allies are interfering. The fact that they are denying doing it is truly messed up. I hope these poor children who survived are able to get the healthcare they so desperately deserved. Could you guys imagine if this was happening here??",disgust
307,"Thomas referred the case to the full court, and shortly before midnight, the justices issued an order granting Arthur’s stay request. The order included a statement from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote. Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito would have rejected the requ",neutral
136,This story left me feeling pretty confused. It was so short and didn't provide a lot of answers at all. I was left wondering why France wanted to dismantle the camp and why the refugees were so angry and against the move. What was really going on here? Were there some other issues that had nothing to do with humanitarian considerations? It seems like there's usually more to the story with refugee stories.,surprise

I'm angry and dissapointed I cant imagine how they must feel.",sadness
401,"If we think we have it bad having to put up with Trump, think about how Mexico feels. This article puts a lot in perspective, but I really struggle with the quote by the Mexican foreign minister saying that Americans chose racism and hate. Don't group us all in one category. We didn't ALL choose this clown to be president. I understand their fears and stress, but that comment really just rubbed me the wrong way. Hopefully both countries can maintain their ties until he's out of office.",sadness
307,"Dear friend,  I have just finished reading a very interesting and somewhat disturbing article. It was about Thomas Arthur, an inmate on death row in Alabama. There began a massive legal battle between the courts, justices, and lawyers about the legality and morality of lethal injection practices. I feel conflicted because on one hand, these people committed unthinkable crimes and deserve severe punishment, but on the other hand, taking a life may still not be justifiable.",sadness

Maybe you didn't even interact with them and they just decided to kill you for fun. It's deeply troubling and makes you suspicious of every stranger on the street. I also feel bad for those who had to witness this and didn't have time to do anything to stop it. I'd imagine some feel guilty even though they couldn't have helped.",fear
13,"It is really sad the way that people only see one side of the story of the Afghan war.  We only see things from our side of the pond, and we see the good , but not all of the bad that we do, as a country.  We tend to think of things, in generalities, and lump groups of people who live in a common area, into one pile of terrorists.  There are plenty of people in Afghanistan who are against eh taliban, and we dont see the damage that we are doing by hitting them with drone strikes.  Most casualties in wars are civilians , who had nothing to do with the conflict itself.  There are always conflicting stories about the death tolls.  I believe it is used to de-escalate our fears that , we, as a country, are doing something that could actually turn out to be very harmful instead of helpful",sadness

I am not a fan of President Trump by any means, but I also have not once thought about comparing him to such a horrific part of the history of this world.  Jews should not be worried that there will be another holocaust or that they will have to go back into concentration camps.  I don't think the country would ever let that happen again, and I don't think that Donald Trump would go down that road either. He has a tendency to act like a child, but that would be a far stretch, even for him.",anger

When we quit and win our freedom from addiction, our mindset changes. After I quit I came to realize how much I really don't like it!

It's a good point, about having to get the fishers on board with saving the paquita, but I don't know how to convince them. If it came down to feeding my family or saving a handful of dolphins that are probably going to die out anyway, there's a good chance I'd pick my family.

360,"Just read an article that explored Trump's appeal and why he won the election.  It indicated that Trump had a simple appeal to the darker side of people, the look out for myself and not others side, it explored Trump's ability to partner with those that are hurting and feel left out of society through lack of jobs, etc.  He used this association to promote his agenda, with simple phrases that were easy to remember, and tailored it to the good old boy network.  The article didn't really explore Russia's influence on the election, only addressed Trump's appeal to certain groups.",neutral

Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted.

War is hell, and it can--and often does--do a ringer to your psyche and overall mental health.

360,There are no words for how much I ignore Trump and his antics. It has made me numb and lose hope in the whole system. I no longer feel anything loyalty for America or its system. I think it is all a sham and no one should have to feel like that about their own country where they pay taxes to live and work and breathe.,anger
288,This is troubling as it is unusual to have two people die of this cause at the same time. This seems suspicious as well.

I am just saddened that political and ideological strife will deny not only teacher from working, but for students to be able to have a quality education. What can we do to help? Let me know if you know what we can rally against.",sadness
111,I just read an article about an elementary school volunteer producing child porn with kids as young as NINE. This is absolutely disgusting. How can anyone violate our sweet children like that. He gave out cell phones and used an anonymous social media app to solicit videos and photos of boys and girls performing sexual acts :( I am so perturbed that people are so disgusting. I can promise you if this ever happens to any of my kids they are going to be a very sorry person.,disgust
246,I feel bad for the teachers but there are so many teachers in this country that I would like to see expelled. It is amazing how much power Turkey has. I do not really understand this power but it must be difficult to pack up your life so quickly. I can't imagine having to do that. How does anyone start fresh when they were expelled. You would always feel like it is going to happen again.,sadness

I wonder how long it will take for him to recover?",surprise

It seems very strange that such a huge virus with a widespread development and all of the media attention is now just a minor issue.  It's either hiding somewhere are there's worse on the way.  Or it could have all just been media hype to sell TV.  Hard to say but suspicious all the same.,surprise

Take Mikhail Lesin for example.  The man was very well know and successful and look what happened to him he wound up dead just like everyone else.  Now,  the conclusion is that it was an accident,  but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of speculation.  I guess thats a price you have to pay if you make enemies in the world.  You are either looking over your shoulder all the time or completely stressed to death.  What a world.",fear

The fact that almost 100 percent of the caimans are suspected to be dead is alarming and people should be more informed on such matters. The rate of extinction that these animals and mammals are going through on our planet is extremely alarming and I can not figure out why people aren't more concerned or even aware of the matter. We need to do a better job of protecting ALL living matter on this planet, not just ourselves.",fear

While illegal immigration may have fallen, it's no reason to treat such a big trading partner like a second class world citizen by telling them they have to pay for a wall.

Donald Trump doesn't have enough mercy or understanding for what they are going through. The United States may offer some help, but not nearly enough.

Maybe his golf curse has to catch fire just like the forests. This doesn't only effect us but the whole world and the life on it. United States needs to take action before it's too late.,anger

It is about a Representative named Darrell Issa, he is a Republican and has a Southern California seat. How great would it be, to see this massively bad man lose? Hopefully, Issa may well quote Mercutio on November 8th: “...ask for me to-morrow and you shall find me a grave man.”",disgust
121,Hate seems to be increasing in this country. I just read an article that hate crimes are going up. I don't know what's going on but people can't seem to handle themselves and use restraint. People are becoming too short-fused and trigger happy on attacking others with hate crimes. I hope things get better but the article didn't seem too optimistic. I guess the more we talk about this kind of stuff the better so it doesn't get ignored. It's an important issue.,anger

IT's very sad to think there aren't many people left to share these stories.  I remember being in Junior high and hearing someone speak about it, and to think kids these days will never get that.  Thankfully, there are museums for people to attend to hear and get closer to what truly happened back then.",sadness

I can no longer be moved by this madness because it is something that I can expect because of the mental illness that is prominent in our society. We can no longer feel safe that our protection is the priority today.,surprise
160,This article talks about pouching in Africa. It's really sad hearing about the rhinos. We need to protect these animals. These animals are more important that the people poaching them. Those poachers deserve to die; they are horrible people and they are destroying a unique species. This is a terrible thing. They desperately need to protect these poor rhinoes from people.,sadness

You know that I was in the military myself and it makes it that much harder on me.  I can't begin to imagine how the families of these soldiers must feel.  From what I read, apparently this was an accident and the soldiers were shot when they failed to stop at the checkpoint going into the base.  The base was already on alert due to a previous car bomb attack.  I'm guessing that they felt they couldn't take any chances on it being another car bomber and went ahead and shot at the vehicle.  It's so sad.  It's bad enough that these brave men have to face dangers from the enemy, but when they get taken down by friendly fire?",sadness

While most of the time, I feel that the shooting is justified, with the evidence presented, I definitely think this needs to go to a jury for a decision. I agree that she should have been trained for this scenario, but no one knows exactly what their emotions will be in a situation like this one. It was a domestic violence call, which are extremely dangerous for police officers. But I don't understand why less than lethal methods weren't deployed first.",sadness

279,"If people are concerned about others to where they feel fear. They need to leave the situation entirely. No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.",neutral

This kind of narrative is truly what the modern liberal exists upon. It's disgusting. I'm not a Trump fan, but mark my words, this kind of crap will be the reason why he wins in 2020.",disgust

It's sad that people won't come forward on their own to bring justice and that there has to be a monetary incentive.",sadness

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.",fear

I urge you to donate and make a difference in these people's lives especially the children who are suffering and don't have anything to eat. Every dollar will count I think",sadness

I think so many of us, even knowing the risks, think that ""it can't happen to me"" and do things we shouldn't.  It's so sad for their families!  I'm not sure what is the right thing to do.  Signs are posted, and divers know the risks.  But would it be better to permanently close the area?  I'm on the fence.",sadness

This is a strategy that is doomed to failure for multiple reasons, the biggest being the civilians they are using aren't going to tolerate that shit forever, and will probably start resisting and escaping. The next biggest, America doesn't really show restraint when they want to bomb a target and civilians are present. I mean, we generally go out of our way to not blow up the nearby children's hospital, but the second we suspect Bin Laden's cousin is in there 7000 drones start swarming.",neutral

Capitalism that reinforces these disgusting habits must be destroyed utterly and the Christian religion should be wiped out in its entirety.

They were riding on the back of a trailer when they got hit by another car. That is so unsafe. I wouldn't even want to do that with other adults, let alone children.",anger
309,I feel so bad for that innocent customer. This is something that is unfortunate and a random freak incident. All over a declined card this man got so upset that he had to take it out on other people. It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go. You can't even go to the coffee shop without worrying someone is going to pull out a gun at you.,fear
56,I understand why this is a problem but I don't see any reason to get upset over it. It seemed like they were writing about it with more emotion than the situation deserves. Trees die all the time. They're replaced by something else. It's extremely common. I get that it's worth given current climate conditions but still.,sadness
404,That is really sad to hear. It's awful that cars can be so unsafe and sometimes people forget how easy it is to get into an accident if everyone isn't careful and observant. It said this happened at 6:30pm so I wonder if maybe the sun was shining right in someone's eyes because that has happened to me at sunset and I could barely see. It's difficult to pull over and stop in those conditions as well.,sadness

I don't know what it would be like to have to live in fear that your own country is going to be bombed, let alone receiving a messages basically telling you that if you don't get out now you could die from a bombing. Politics is making life so hard for so many innocent people.",sadness
7,I feel horrible that this is happening. It probably a lot to do with what America has done in that country. They are the ones who armed the rebels and caused this problem. America created the terrorists groups. I know I am not responsible but it makes me sick to know that intelligence agencies from our own countries instigated this problem. I feel sympathy for all those who have been killed and the families who's lives have been ruined.,sadness
186,The article that I just read was about the ongoing violence and fighting between Kenya and South Sudan. The words in the article really struck a nerve with me. It made me cry. There have been thousands of people who have lost their lives during this argument. It makes me want to reach out and help in any way possible. The fighting needs to stop and peace needs to be restored between these two nations.,sadness

Gay rights protesters were rounded up by police and taken away from the resort where they were protesting and of those that attempted to resume protesting at another spot, police escorted them away. Gay rights have been struggling in Uganda, where homosexuality is illegal and repressed.",anger

Please help me think of ways we can work on making this a nonissue in the future for the next generation. This is our kids and grandkids future we are thinking of.",surprise
66,The results of the fire could have been worse. I'm just glad nobody died.  Stuff can always be replaced.  Burns are the worst since they're so painful.  Hopefully these people have some family they can stay with until they're able to find a new housing situation. That's great that the firemen were able to get the fire under control so quickly.,sadness

I can believe that it happens with teenagers, but it's starting to become more common in children and preteens too.  I can't imagine the anguish you would feel to lose a young child to suicide.  I can't imagine how you would move on from that.",sadness
148,I'm not sure how to feel about animals that are considered as abused when being used for entertainment purposes. It gives us the opportunity to learn and see them up close but at the same time its hard to handle the fact that these animals might be feeling pain. I mean imagine being captive by monkeys your whole life so they can introduce them to humans. Would be sad.,sadness
247,Remembering those who have lost their lives due to violence is so important. Do you remember what happened in Paris in 2015? I am so grateful that the people there set aside a special time to remember all the victims and their families. Such a senseless loss. People just wanting to enjoy some entertainment were met with a horrific experience and families were forced to wait in pain to hear news of the outcome. I am sure they will never forget that day.  I do hope each day gets easier for them and that they remember the good memories of their loved ones.,sadness
244,It must be extremely difficult to find these lone wolf terrorist. I can only begin to understand the type of manpower needed to pursue these people. I think that most of them are mentally ill and hard to catch before they commit the crime. It makes me think of the movie Minority Report and how that type of technology might become available with the advance of A.I..,neutral

Morocco could see increased temperatures and drought that would drive the southern deserts further north, displacing forests. Deserts would expand in the Middle East, pushing temperate forests higher into the mountains. Average temperatures in the region have already risen by 1.3°C since the late 19th century, well above the world average of 0.85°C, according to the study.""  And we are still arguing over coal as a fuel source so that the billionaires can make more billions.

His popularity continued to grow as he aged, and he was able to reap some rewards, but it didn't really catch up with his needs until recent years. He was a Buddhist monk, too. Had no idea. He clearly raised the bar in song writing.",joy

Feelings are also known as a state of consciousness, such as that resulting from emotions, sentiments or desires.  People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful. Or, they find the product useful in some way, even indirectly such as to support a charity or for altruistic economic reasons. Some people buy beauty products in hopes of achieving a state of happiness or a sense of self beauty or as an act or expression of beauty",neutral

The boys were so young and helpless with a dead beat dad. The man should of just killed himself and left those 2 boys out of it. What did he accomplish by killing his sons? I have no words to describe how much pain those 2 little ones were probably in. Its ashame when kids have to take fault for thier parents misfortunes. And that mother. The heart ache she will have to face of losing not only 1 son but 2. I cannot imagine the sorrow that woukd cause.,anger

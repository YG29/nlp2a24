# Emotion Classifier
main objective is to develop and evaluate an emotion classifier model

main tasks:
1. Select a suitable NLP toolkit or framework for building the emotion classifier.
2. Select a dataset for training and evaluating the classifier and perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
3. Implement an appropriate machine learning or deep learning algorithm for classifying emotions from textual data.
4. Train and evaluate the emotion classifier on the chosen dataset, using appropriate performance metrics. Use your knowledge and skills from the introduction to machine learning and neural network courses.
5. Analyze the results of the model and make recommendations for improving the classifier's performance. Use visualization in the analysis of the results.

The final deliverables from this task will be a working implementation of the emotion classifier:
1. The working implementation should contain code for Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering(TF-IDF, Word2vec), Model Selection, Training and
Evaluation.
2. A detailed description of the chosen dataset, training procedure, and evaluation metrics.
3. A comprehensive analysis of the classifier's performance, including confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
4. Suggestions for improving the classifier's performance, considering factors such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model architecture.
